# Requirements

Prerequisites:

Please see the course outlines for prerequisites for SENG 480A and BCOM 450.

General Requirements:

- Attendance in all course meetings is **mandatory**. If you have to miss one meeting, please let us know ahead of time. You may be able to attend by zoom if you have covid but only if we know in advance. Missing a class or not attending in person will require *additional course work* (assignment and due date to be arranged). Missing multiple course lectures (even due to illness) may mean you have to drop the course as attending the lectures is a requirement to complete the course work. 
- Students may be assigned a different grade to their team project grade.  Individual grades will be based on attestations of individual contributions and evaluations by team members of other members. 

Each team is required to do the following:

1. Follow the updates on this GitHub site.
2. Attend all the lectures along the semester.
3. Come up with a project and present the idea, scope and architecture to the class (5% of grade).
    - Obtain approval for the project.
    - Project will include both server side and client side development.
    - Project needs to be publicly available (e.g. for mentors and future students).
    - Project needs to be scalable - it can not be hosted on your own machine, no manual input of data (automate it), and it should be running after the semester ends.
4. Prepare a workplan for the implementation, including at least 3 mid-point milestones (dates will be published on the course schedule).
    - Presentation of these milestones will be part of the grade (15%, 25% and 25% of the grade).
5. At each milestone:
    - Present status and a working demo to the class. All teams are required to attend presentations by the other teams.
    - Submit code (please open a GitHub repository).
    - Submit presentation files (PPTX / PDF / link to online presentation).
    - Provide a link to a demo of the application (link to live application or a demo video).
6. Listen to feedback (given by other students and the staff members). Listen and carefully consider the feedback of all mentors. You will be responsible for taking notes and keeping track of this feedback.  
7. Setup a web page (using GitHub) containing all the the above docs, presentations, screenshots, videos and download links.
8. A completed comprehensive Business Model Canvas with supporting documentation
9. Have a live working application on the web!
    - If web application, must support Firefox and Chrome/Chromium (current stable version of each).
    - If mobile application, support a stable version of Android or iOS.
    - The application needs to be fully working even after the course has ended.
