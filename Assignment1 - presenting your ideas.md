# Assignment #1: Presenting Your Ideas

## Assignment Overview 

The objective of Assignment #1 is to get preliminary feedback from your mentors on your initial app idea. Developing your app will be an iterative process throughout the term of idea-build-learn-revise. Getting early feedback helps to ensure that you have a strong foundation before you invest considerable time in building out your solution. We all recognize that this is very early days in the development process but with this assignment we are forcing you to begin to clearly articulate the key problem/solution and features of your app product. Importantly, when you can clearly describe what it is you are wanting to build, you can start to get feedback from others on your concept to help it grow stronger.

Please note that all teams are required to be present for all other teams’ presentations. Why? Because it is highly likely that problems that other teams face you will also face at some point. The feedback that you hear from mentors about other apps is likely to be directly relevant to work on your team’s app now or down the road.

**If you haven't done so already, please send us an email with the names of your team members** ([startup.programming@gmail.com](mailto:startup.programming@gmail.com)).

## Assignment Details 

In our third meeting (**20/09/2024**) you should present your project idea -- we recognize this is a work in progress!

Each team presentation will have **13 minutes** as follows (strict time limit):

- In the first **5 minutes** you will present the main scenario (**use-case**) and users (**target audience**) that your application targets.
    - Describe the situation, the need (**the problem**), the data you will need to build your app, and the decisions made in the process.
    - Describe **who** you think cares about this problem/solution and why? Do you think they care enough to pay for it?!
    - Describe the overall **architecture** of the application (high level). What functionality will be implemented in each part? (client/server/mobile/external sources/etc.)
    - Estimate what can be **demonstrated** in Milestone 1 (which features will you aim to have), and what can be demonstrated in Milestones 2 and 3 (of course this is likely to evolve). 
    - If possible, include a few **UI mockups** in your presentation (obviously very early ideas - we will show you some UI mockup tools in the following week).
    
- In the next **8 minutes** you will answer questions from the mentors. During this discussion, the course mentors will estimate whether your use-case is well developed and your estimations are realistic.
- The main feedback from mentors will be summarized and sent to you after the class. 
- You won’t remember all of the feedback that you receive from the mentors. Please assign one team member to **WRITE DOWN the feedback** during your presentation so you have a record to take into your next meetings.

**Some Tips:**

- Early feedback, even before the proposal presentation day, is a good thing! It is advisable that you send us your idea as soon as possible via email ([startup.programming@gmail.com](mailto:startup.programming@gmail.com)) - this can save you a lot of time (e.g. if you took a wrong direction, impossible mission, etc.).
- 13 minutes is a very short time for your presentation and feedback! You have 5 minutes for your presentation - rehearse your timing.
- If you plan to use slides for your presentation (PowerPoint or Google Slides), avoid adding too much text/content per slide. 
- Be visual: if you have already thought about the user interface, you may show a sketch of it in the presentation.
- You may bring your own laptop (so no compatibility problems would occur during your presentation).
- Be simple and precise.
- Rehearse your presentation within the team and make sure you are all on the same page.
- For creating UI mockups consider using [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/download/), free for 30 days. Other UI prototyping tools are listed on the resources page.

## Readings
- Watch some of the Y Combinator Office Hours videos from a few years ago ([YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cWPxuxqdGQ)), also see this article from [Stripe](https://stripe.com/en-ca/guides/atlas/pitching) and check other resources to inspire you!
- Consider the 5 U's of pain when thinking about your idea [see slide 6 of this deck](https://www.slideshare.net/zephram/the-ideal-business-idea)
- Other resources are available in the resources folder and we recommend you refer to these readings

## Evaluation Criteria

Your project proposal presentations and materials will be graded based on the following criteria (out of 100 points):

- Need/problem clearly stated	(10 points)
- The need/problem is established as compelling (10 points)
- A clear and compelling solution is presented (10 points)
- Effective demonstration of the app idea through initial UI mockups (10 points)
- The data needed to build the app is identified (10 points)
- Effective consideration of the overall app architecture, including client/server/mobile/external resources (10 points)
- Effective consideration of what can be demonstrated in subsequent milestones (10 points)
- Effective engagement with the mentors in the Q&A (10 points)
- Demonstration of teamwork (10 points)
- Professionalism of the presentation (10 points)

Good luck!
